              I'm a millennial who took a very millennial career path and
              accidentally assembled a killer set of design, marketing, and tech
              skills.
            </p>
            <p>
              I've got more than a decade of expertise in web design/development
              and digital marketing. My last in-house job was with Huge, a
              global design and technology powerhouse, where I was a User
              Interface Engineer on the Google account.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a marketer, I've worked for agencies such as Saatchi & Saatchi,
              Wunderman, Track DDB, and The JAR Group, and I've managed brands
              including Procter and Gamble, Unilever, Kraft, Scotiabank, and
              Toyota.
            </p>
            <p>
              As a freelancer, I've built sites and brands for marketing
              agencies, wellness practitioners, and boutique clothing brands.
            </p>

              What does all this mean for you? It means that I know how to
              identify your audience and speak to them. I know how to build and
              customize a wide variety of websites, so you'll never be stuck
              with a template that isn't the right fit. But most of all? It
              means that I have a whole assortment of tools under my belt for
              design, marketing, and tech, and you'll be able to access every
              single one of them.
